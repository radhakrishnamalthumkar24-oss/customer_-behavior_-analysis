# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, from raw data ingestion to business insights delivery.
The goal is to showcase practical skills in **Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dashboarding, and reporting** using industry-standard tools.

The project includes:

* Loading and analyzing data using Python
* Performing EDA and data cleaning
* Querying data using SQL across relational databases
* Building an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Creating a professional report and presentation

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** (Add source if public, or mention “Provided dataset” / “Simulated business data”)
* **Format:** CSV / Excel
* **Description:**
  The dataset contains structured data related to (e.g., sales, customers, operations, finance — update as needed). It includes multiple variables such as dates, categories, numerical metrics, and identifiers.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **SQL:** Data querying, joins, aggregations, filtering
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Reporting:** Power BI Reports
* **Presentation:** Gamma (AI-powered presentation tool)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Project Workflow / Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported raw data into Python using Pandas
   * Validated schema and data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distributions and trends
   * Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
   * Generated summary statistics and visual insights

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

   * Handled missing and duplicate records
   * Standardized column names and formats
   * Created derived metrics for analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into relational databases
   * Executed SQL queries using:

     * PostgreSQL
     * MySQL
     * SQL Server
   * Performed joins, aggregations, and business-focused queries

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   * Added KPIs, filters, and trend visualizations
   * Designed for business and recruiter readability

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a structured analytical report
   * Developed a professional presentation using Gamma
   * Focused on insights, recommendations, and storytelling

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis over time
* Category-wise and segment-wise breakdowns
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

📊 *Dashboard screenshots or Power BI file can be found in the `/dashboard` folder.*

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighted performance drivers and problem areas
* Delivered actionable insights supported by data
* Demonstrated ability to translate data into business value

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analytics-project.git
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and data cleaning:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Load cleaned data into your preferred SQL database:

   * PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

5. Execute SQL queries from the `/sql` folder

6. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore the dashboard
